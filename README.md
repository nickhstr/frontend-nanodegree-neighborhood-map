# Neighborhood Map

### A web app displaying Yelp's top 20 places in San Francisco, CA

#### Getting Started

- There are two ways to use this app: 
  - Just [go to the site](http://nickhstr.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map/) and the locations will load automatically.
  - Or, download the files (either directly or by cloning them), and open index.html with your browser of choice (I prefer Chrome).

- You can click on a marker or item in the list (shown by clicking the yelp logo, for those of you on mobile) to get more info about a place.

- Additionally, you can use the search bar to filter by name or category (such as "coffee"). If you want to show all the locations again, simply empty the search bar and submit.
